title: Bernoulli Mixture Models for Markov Blanket Filtering and Classification
abstract: This paper presents the use of Bernoulli mixture models for Markov blanket  filtering
  and classification of binary data. Bernoulli mixture models can  be seen as a tool
  for partitioning an n-dimensional hypercube, identifying  regions of high data density
  on the corners of the hypercube. Once Bernoulli  mixture models are computed from
  a training dataset we use them for determining  the Markov blanket of the target
  variable. An algorithm for Markov blanket  filtering was proposed by Koller and
  Sahami (1996), which is a greedy search   method for feature subset selection and
  it outputs an approximation to the  optimal feature selection criterion. However,
  they use the entire training  instances for computing the conditioning sets and
  have to limit the size of these sets for computational efficiency and avoiding data
  fragmentation. We have adapted their algorithm to use Bernoulli mixture models instead,
  hence, overcoming the short comings of their algorithm and increasing the  efficiency
  of this algorithm considerably. Once a feature subset is identified we perform classification
  using these mixture models. We have applied this algorithm to the causality challenge
  datasets. Our prediction scores were ranked fourth on SIDO and our feature scores
  were ranked the best for test sets 1 and 2 of the same dataset.
