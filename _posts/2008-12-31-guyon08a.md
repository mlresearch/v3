title: Design and Analysis of the Causation and Prediction Challenge
abstract: 'We organized for WCCI 2008 a challenge to evaluate causal modeling techniques,  focusing
  on predicting the effect of “interventions” performed by an external  agent. Examples
  of that problem are found in the medical domain to predict  the effect of a drug
  prior to administering it, or in econometrics to predict  the effect of a new policy
  prior to issuing it. We concentrate on a given  target variable to be predicted
  (e.g., health status of a patient) from a  number of candidate predictive variables
  or “features” (e.g., risk factors  in the medical domain). Under interventions,
  variable predictive power and  causality are tied together. For instance, both smoking
  and coughing may be predictive of lung cancer (the target) in the absence of external
  intervention;  however, prohibiting smoking (a possible cause) may prevent lung
  cancer, but administering a cough medicine to stop coughing (a possible consequence)
  would not. We propose four tasks from various application domains, each dataset  including
  a training set drawn from a “natural” distribution and three test  sets: one from
  the same distribution as the training set and two corresponding  to data drawn when
  an external agent is manipulating certain variables. The  goal is to predict a binary
  target variable, whose values on test data are  withheld. The participants were
  asked to provide predictions of the target  variable on test data and the list of
  variables (features) used to make predictions.  The challenge platform remains open
  for post-challenge submissions and the  organization of other events is under way
  (see http://clopinet.com/causality).'
