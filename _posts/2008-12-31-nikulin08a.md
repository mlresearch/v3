title: Random Sets Approach and its Applications
abstract: The random sets approach is heuristic in nature and has been inspired by  the
  growing speed of computations. For example, we can consider a large number  of classifiers
  where any single classifier is based on a relatively small  subset of randomly selected
  features or random sets of features. Using cross-validation  we can rank all random
  sets according to the selected criterion, and use this ranking for further feature
  selection. Another application of random sets was motivated by the huge imbalanced
  data, which represent significant  problem because the corresponding classifier
  has a tendency to ignore patterns with smaller representation in the training set.
  Again, we propose to consider  a large number of balanced training subsets where
  representatives from both  patterns are selected randomly. The above models demonstrated
  competitive  results in two data mining competitions.
