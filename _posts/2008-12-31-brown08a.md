title: A Strategy for Making Predictions Under Manipulation
abstract: 'The first Causality Challenge competition posted several causal discovery  problems
  that require researchers to employ the full arsenal of state-of-the-art  causal
  discovery methods, while prompting the development of new ones. Our  approach used
  the formalism of Causal Bayesian Networks to model and induce  causal relations
  and to make predictions about the effects of the manipulation  of the variables.
  Using state-of-the-art, under development, or newly invented  methods specifically
  for the purposes of the competition, we addressed the  following problems in turn
  in order to build and evaluate a model: (a) finding  the Markov Blanket of the target
  even under some non-faithfulness conditions  (e.g., parity functions), (b) reducing
  the problems to a size manageable by subsequent algorithms, (c) identifying and
  orienting the network edges, (d) identifying causal edges (i.e., not confounded),
  and (e) selecting the causal Markov Blanket of the target in the manipulated distribution.
  The results of the competition illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of
  the state-of-the-art of causal discovery methods and point to new directions in
  the field. An implementation of our approach is available at http://www.dsl-lab.org  for
  use by other researchers.'
