title: Causal & Non-Causal Feature Selection for Ridge Regression
abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of causal and non-causal feature selection
  methods for linear classifiers in situations where the causal relationships between
  the input and response variables may differ between the training and operational
  data. The causal feature selection methods investigated include inference of the
  Markov Blanket and inference of direct causes and of direct effects. The non-causal
  feature selection method is based on logistic regression with Bayesian regularisation
  using a Laplace prior. A simple ridge regression model is used as the base classifier,
  where the ridge parameter is efficiently tuned so as to minimise the leave-one-out
  error, via eigen-decomposition of the data covariance matrix. For tasks with more
  features than patterns, linear kernel ridge regression is used for computational
  efficiency. Results are presented for all of the WCCI-2008 Causation and Prediction
  Challenge datasets, demonstrating that, somewhat surprisingly, causal feature selection
  procedures do not provide significant benefits in terms of predictive accuracy over
  non-causal feature selection and/or classification using the entire feature set.
