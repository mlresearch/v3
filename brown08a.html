<h3>Abstract</h3>
    The first Causality Challenge competition posted several causal discovery
 problems that require researchers to employ the full arsenal of state-of-the-art
 causal discovery methods, while prompting the development of new ones. Our
 approach used the formalism of Causal Bayesian Networks to model and induce
 causal relations and to make predictions about the effects of the manipulation
 of the variables. Using state-of-the-art, under development, or newly invented
 methods specifically for the purposes of the competition, we addressed the
 following problems in turn in order to build and evaluate a model: (a) finding
 the Markov Blanket of the target even under some non-faithfulness conditions
 (e.g., parity functions), (b) reducing the problems to a size manageable
by subsequent algorithms, (c) identifying and orienting the network edges,
(d) identifying causal edges (i.e., not confounded), and (e) selecting the
causal Markov Blanket of the target in the manipulated distribution. The
results of the competition illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses
of the state-of-the-art of causal discovery methods and point to new directions
in the field. An implementation of our approach is available at http://www.dsl-lab.org
 for use by other researchers. </div>
