title: Feature Ranking Using Linear SVM
abstract: Feature ranking is useful to gain knowledge of data and identify relevant   features.
  This article explores the performance of combining linear support   vector machines
  with various feature ranking methods, and reports the experiments   conducted when
  participating the Causality Challenge. Experiments show that   a feature ranking
  using weights from linear SVM models yields good performances,   even when the training
  and testing data are not identically distributed.  Checking the difference of Area
  Under Curve (AUC) with and without removing  each feature also gives similar rankings.
  Our study indicates that linear   SVMs with simple feature rankings are effective
  on data sets in the Causality  Challenge.
